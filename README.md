# news-online-jekyll-template

SEO-optimized and fully responsive Jekyll template for an entertainment news site ready for automated daily update and regeneration.

[Demo](https://mouse-auto-clickers.online/)

## Usage

Under Windows, after Jekyll installation done, simply run \_\_serve.bat, it regenerates the whole site and listens as local http site at 0.0.0.0:4000.

NOTE. At very first time run "bundle install --standalone".

To deploy for production, take any text parser of your choice and replace all the entries of "http://0.0.0.0:4000/" to "https://yourdomain.com/" in the file "_site\\assets\\js\\lunrsearchengine.js".

IMPORTANT. Update _config.yml according "yourdomain.com" and other settings.
